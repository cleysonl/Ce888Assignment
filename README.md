# Ce888Assignment
*Final Assignment for Data Science and Decision Making*

### To do list:
Compare the performance and visualise regressors that were meant to give interpretable results - linear regression and decision trees.
a) Identify three multivariate regression datasets from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html] - the choice is yours. 
b) Run a linear regressor with high l1 regularisation on all of the datasets and record the results using 10-fold cross-validation. 
Note that you might have to pre-process variables (e.g. one-hot encodings, normalisation)
c) Run a decision tree regressor with a maximum depth of three in all of the datasets and record the results using 10-fold cross-validation. 
d) Compare the two regressors in terms of quality, but also of interpretability. See here on how to visualise decision trees: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html. For the linear regressor/classifier you need to get the weights and bias (see variables coef_, intercept_) - also see see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html
